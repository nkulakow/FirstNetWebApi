# Hi!

This is my first ever project using C# (.Net 7), Web API and Entity Framework for SQL Server.

We have a set of simple RPG Characters on which we can apply all CRUD operations.

Followed this guy tutorial: https://youtu.be/9zJn3a7L1uE, check him out if you're interested.

I plan to finish his tutorial and then try to expand this project more.

Maybe I'll add some "frontend code" for better visualization, who knows :)
